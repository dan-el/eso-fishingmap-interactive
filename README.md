# ESO Fishing Map (Interactive)
#### A simple project with some HTML, CSS, and SVG to create an interactive fishing map for ESO.

This is similar to "ESO Fishing Map (Classic)" and based on the same source data. I am experimenting with some interactive elements here like toggling fishing holes, adding in some more infos etc.

#### Special thanks to
