# ESO Fishing Map (Interactive)
#### A simple project with some HTML, CSS, and SVG to create an interactive fishing map for ESO.

This is similar to the "ESO Fishing Map (Classic)" and is also based on the same source data. I am experimenting with some interactive elements like toggling fishing holes, adding in some more info etc.

#### Special thanks to
